## Welcome to my *data-science* repository

This repository contains Data science projects I've worked on, during the course of me learning the subject, with some occasional [notes taken](https://github.com/karthikeyan-ramachandran-git/data-science/tree/master/notes) (for future references).

Some of those projects are listed below:
1. [Boston housing - price prediction](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/karthikeyan-ramachandran-git/data-science/blob/master/boston-housing/linear%20regression%20with%20scikit%20learn.ipynb)  
Contains a Linear regression model created with `Python` language using Scikit-learn library, to estimate Boston housing price based on the info collected from 506 neighborhoods around Boston on 13 features such as average number of rooms per house, average age of house, percent of household with low economic status.
2. [Auto](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/karthikeyan-ramachandran-git/data-science/blob/master/auto/Auto%20-%20data%20analysis%20-%20R.ipynb)  
Contains analysis of the Auto dataset with info about 392 cars from the 70's on 9 features, to uderstand the effects of each feature on the Fuel-efficiency of every car using `R`.
3. [Machine-Learning-Bootcamp-in-R](https://github.com/karthikeyan-ramachandran-git/data-science/tree/master/Machine-Learning-Bootcamp-in-R)  
Contains R-Markdown files for the Machine learning exercises from [Udemy's Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp with R](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp-with-r/)
